# Decisions

Constitution Article VIII: when a design decision is genuinely open, append one line
here — the decision and a one-clause rationale — and keep going. Do not stop work to
ask a question you can answer with a defensible default.

This file exists so the first node to hit a fork does not have to invent a format.

## Format

One decision per line. Append to the end. Never edit or delete an existing line —
a decision that was later reversed gets a **new** line saying so, because the value
of this file is the trail, not the current state.

```
- YYYY-MM-DD | <spec-id> | <the decision, stated as a choice> — <one-clause rationale>
```

- **`<spec-id>`** is the feature directory the node was working in (`001-scaffold`),
  or `operator` when a human decided it outside a node.
- **The decision** names what was chosen, not what was considered. "Doors are a state
  machine" — not "considered several door approaches".
- **The rationale** is one clause. If it needs a paragraph, it is not a defensible
  default and belongs in an escalation instead.
- Reversals: `— reverses the <date> entry, because <clause>`.

Anything larger than one line — a decision that reshapes the architecture, or one you
cannot defend without prose — is not a DECISIONS entry. Raise it as an escalation and
let the operator answer.

## Log

- 2026-08-29 | operator | DECISIONS.md is a flat append-only line log, not numbered ADR files — Article VIII asks for one line and a rationale, and a directory of documents would invite essays the constitution explicitly does not want.
